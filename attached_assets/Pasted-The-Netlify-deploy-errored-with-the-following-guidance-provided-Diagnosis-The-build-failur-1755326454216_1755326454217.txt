The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is caused by the command `vite build` not being recognized, resulting in the error `sh: 1: vite: not found` [#L85](#L85).

### Solution
1. **Missing Dependency:** The error indicates that `vite` is not found, which suggests that the Vite package is not installed.
   
2. **Solution Steps:**
   - Ensure that `vite` is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file.
   - Verify that the `vite` package is added to the `package.json` by running:
     ```bash
     npm install vite --save-dev
     ```
   - If `vite` is already in the `package.json`, confirm that it was committed to the repository.
   
3. After confirming the presence of `vite` in the dependencies and committing any changes, trigger a new build to see if the issue is resolved.
