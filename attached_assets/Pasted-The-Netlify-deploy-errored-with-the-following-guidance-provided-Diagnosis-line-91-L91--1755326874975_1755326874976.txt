The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 91](#L91): The package 'vite' at version 7.1.2 was not found and needs to be installed, causing an error during the build process.
[line 92](#L92): The build script returned a non-zero exit code 2 due to the missing 'vite' package.
[line 93](#L93) - [line 103](#L103): The error "Cannot find package 'vite' imported from /opt/build/repo/node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts" occurred during the build.

### Solution
1. The 'vite' package at version 7.1.2 needs to be added as a dependency. Verify the package is in the `package.json` file.
2. Run the following command to install the missing package 'vite':
    ```bash
    npm install vite@7.1.2
    ```
3. After installing the 'vite' package, retry the build to ensure the dependency is resolved correctly.
